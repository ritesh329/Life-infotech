# Project Overview
Project Overview:
The repository hosts a single‑page React application built with Vite. It functions as a modern marketing/landing site for a business, showcasing a hero carousel (AutoSliderHero), strategy highlights (BusinessStrategy), service listings (ServicesSection and Services2), and a contact footer (FooterContact). The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, with PostCSS and ESLint configured for code quality and consistency. All source code lives under `frontend/src`, organized into reusable components, and the project uses the latest React features via Vite’s fast development server.
